I'm a big fan of NASA and I noticed that their app was a bit outdated, so I redesigned it. I wanted to keep the flow of their current design, but modernize the style. Round out some of the boxes and really attempt to bring that futuristic space aesthetic to this design. I went through all of NASA's pages and redesigned each one, this project took about a day to complete.\",\n    githubUrl: null,\n    projectUrl:\n      \"https://www.behance.net/gallery/73414189/NASA-Mobile-App-Redesign\",\n    languages: \"Adobe Photoshop CC\"\n  },\n  {\n    id: 5,\n    projectName: \"BlackHole\",\n    projectType: \"Web Development\",\n    projectImg: blackholeFull,\n    projectThumbnail: blackhole,\n    projectRole: \"Front-End Developer & UI / UX Designer\",\n    projectDesc:\n      \"BlackHole is a React-Web App that is the best stress reliever ever made!
